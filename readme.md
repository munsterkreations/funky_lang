# Funky_Lang

> ## The gem Funky_Lang is a Ruby library designed to provide tools for working with the Funky programming language. Here's a summary of its key features and components:

> ##Lexer: The Funky gem includes a lexer component responsible for tokenizing Funky code. The lexer analyzes the input code and breaks it down into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings, and operators.

> ##Parser: It also contains a parser component, which parses the tokenized Funky code and builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation. The parser defines grammar rules for Funky syntax and recursively analyzes the tokens to create a structured representation of the code.

> ##Compiler: The Funky gem includes a compiler component responsible for translating the AST representation of Funky code into executable code. The compiler traverses the AST and generates executable instructions or bytecode suitable for execution on a virtual machine or target platform.

> ##Semantic Analysis: The gem may include a semantic analysis component that performs additional checks and validations on the parsed AST. This analysis ensures that the code follows semantic rules and detects errors or inconsistencies that may arise during compilation or execution.

> ##Console and Bin Files: The Funky gem may provide console tools and binary executable files for interacting with Funky code. These tools allow users to run Funky programs, execute code snippets, and perform various tasks related to development and testing.

> ##Overall, the Funky gem aims to facilitate the development, compilation, and execution of Funky programs, providing developers with the necessary tools to work effectively with the language.
